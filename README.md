# Introduction

This is a simple container built from PostgreSQL 16-alpine, a dbo role (not a superuser) and installed pgTAP 1.3.4

# Why yet another PostgreSQL and pgTAP Docker?
Well, because I wanted an a standardized image that doesn't use a superuser (postgres by defult) for executing application database migrations, that I could use for all my projects.

So use it or don't! In any event, have fun, be safe and ofc "Do not run sh%& as root! :)"
